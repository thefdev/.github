## Welcome to FDEV!

FDEV is a well-known organization that brings together freelancers to work together on a wide range of projects, serving both small and large clients locally and globally through online platforms.

Our main goal is to ensure complete satisfaction for FDEV's businesses and clients. We consistently strive to deliver outstanding results and complete projects within tight deadlines, saving our clients valuable time. The team members at FDEV are highly skilled programmers with extensive expertise in software engineering, boasting over 2 years of experience.

With over 2 years of operation in Vietnam and international markets, FDEV has recently expanded into the Facebook market. This gives us the confidence to meet the diverse needs of our valued clients.

We greatly appreciate the collaboration of our dedicated team members at FDEV, who have played a crucial role in shaping the growth of our organization.

## How we work

Our primary objective at FDev is to streamline the process of product fulfillment and ensure simplicity for both our valued members and customers. To achieve this, we follow a systematic approach that caters to the needs of our clients and freelancers. Here is an outline of the process we undertake:

1. Market Research: We extensively explore recruitment markets, student projects, and various freelance platforms to identify suitable projects for our FDev members.

2. Project Acquisition: Once we find a potential project, we initiate negotiations and participate in auctions on these platforms to secure the project.

3. Freelancer Selection: We reach out to our FDev freelancer members and engage in discussions regarding the price they can offer for executing the product. We carefully evaluate the proposals and select a freelancer who provides the most suitable price within our client's budget.

4. Agreement with the Customer: After successfully reaching an agreement with the customer, based on their requirements, expectations, and the proposed price, we proceed to the next step.

5. Project Fee Transfer: We request the customer to transfer the entire project implementation fee to FDev, to ensure a seamless transaction process.

6. Timely Product Delivery: At FDev, we prioritize prompt product delivery. Therefore, we require our freelancers to complete the projects within 7 days. In the case of larger projects, we will renegotiate the deadline with the freelancers.

7. Freelancer Profit: The profit structure for freelancers working on projects with us is as follows:
   - We will hold the entire profit until you successfully complete the project and fulfill the conditions agreed upon with the customer.
   - Once you deliver the fully completed project, meeting the customer's requirements, we will transfer the agreed-upon fee to you without any additional costs or fees.
   - However, if you fail to meet any of the customer's pre-agreed requirements, we will deduct 10% of the project fee as per our agreement. This deduction will gradually increase based on the number of unmet requests agreed upon with us.

By adhering to this process, we strive to ensure a smooth and efficient experience for all parties involved in the product fulfillment journey at FDev.
